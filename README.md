# Ray Casting engine

This is a study elaborating on the 3D projection chapter in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ) tutorial.

Create venv and install requirements. Then run the project:

```
make run map=map01
```

## Map

Maps go inside the `maps` folder.

Wall tile is represented by an `X`, walkable tile by a `_`.

## Insights

- The number of rays directly affects the graphics detail.
